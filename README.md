## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to approach a new set of skills that we would self teach and use. I developed the project utilizing Google's Developer Platform to tap into a user's location and return place details based around certain queries. 

## About the Site
ThereApy was created to help a user find a Therapist close to them, add comments, and to share those comments with other users.
## Technologies Used
ThereApy was built with, React, Redux, Express, and Node.js. CSS/SCSS modules for the design/UI, Google Developer Platform for API's, and Nodemailer for an automated welcome Email upon a user signing up.
